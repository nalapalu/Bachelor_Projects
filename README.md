# University Projects
Projects from my Research Internships during my BS-MS Degree (Bachelor - Masters Of Science)

- **2019:**  

- **2018:** My summer project involved the use of Automatic recording Units (ARUs) in studying the soundscapes in the Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary. I analysed the data using R and Matlab, as well as a proprietary software RAVEN to produce plots and figures

- **2017_2:** The Glauber model is a set of theoretical techniques used to model high energy heavy ion collisions. I used the Glauber model to model these collisions and create
theoretical estimates of these quantities and compare them to indirect experimental observations. I intensively used C++ and ROOT for this assignment

- **2017:** The aim of this project is to study the relation between species diversity and the elevation gradient of bird species in the Western Himalayas. I sampled the data in the region for over a month and spent the next 4 months processing the data in R and its associated packages, vegan, Biodiversity Distance, SPECIES and species estimatorssuch as Chao1 and Jackknife to determine sampling completeness. 

- **2016:** A theroretical Physcis Project where my study primarily revolves around rogue waves in nonlinear optical fibres specifically using one such method of modelling these waves, the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation(NLSE).
